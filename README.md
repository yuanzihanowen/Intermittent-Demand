Intermittent-Demand
===================
These are some of the modules for algorithms that could be used for forecasting.

I forked the despository here for references purposes.

These are codes which need to be repeatedly used in my research project. Different scripts perform different functions. 


The problem is that these codes are not inter linked.  

Matlab Code 1. Croston's Method (function, forecasting)
            2. greyprediction (function forecasting)
            3. Fuzy clustering method (script data)
            
R code: 
            1. ARIMA (script forecasting)
            2. classificatio (function forecasing, pattern classification)
            3. FCM (script fuzzy clustering)
            4. MSE (script MSE calculation)
